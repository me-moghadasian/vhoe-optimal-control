# vhoe-optimal-control (VHOE-OC)
 **VHOE-OC** is designed to solve nonlinear high order optimal control problems.
This software package uses Vectorised High Order Expansions (**VHOE**) method [1] and has been designed 
by Dr. **Mehdi Moghadasian**. 

 This package is available under the *GNU General Public License v3.0*;
please refer to the license file for more information.

This tool supports 3 types of optimal control problems:
    1. Infinite Horizon 
    2. Finite Horizon with Fixed Terminal Time and State
       (Hard Constraint Problem)
    3. Finite Horizon with Fixed Terminal Time and Mayer
       Termial State (Bolza: Soft Constraint Problem)

# Setup
Please run setup script first and then check *examples* folder.
